### Hello!

My name is Colin. I am currently studying Machine Learning at York University. As an aspiring data scientist, I hope to one day contribute to the solution of the climate crisis with the use of machine learning. I love working with Python, R, and SQL and I am constantly learning and improving my skills. 

I am currently working on the [Cassave Leaf Disease Classification Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-leaf-disease-classification) using neural networks on the Google Cloud Platform as my final assignment for the 3rd course in my certificate. 

I am also working on a complete pipeline for analyzing stock market data using Python requests for data collection and parsing, PostgreSQL for database management, RStudio for analysis and visualization, and RShiny/RMarkdown for deoployment and report generation. 

My previous work includes Natural Language Processing for hatespeech detection in Tweets, a Mortality Rate prediction for Covid19 patients, a stock market analytics tool using fundamental analysis and a house price prediction tool for the GTA.
