### Hello!

My name is Colin. I am currently studying Machine Learning at York University. As an aspiring data scientist, I hope to one day contribute to the solution of the climate crisis with the use of machine learning. I love working with Python, R, and SQL and I am constantly learning and improving my skills. 

I am currently working on the [Cassava Leaf Disease Classification Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-leaf-disease-classification) using neural networks on the Google Cloud Platform as my final assignment for the 3rd course in my certificate. 

I am also working on a complete pipeline for analyzing stock market data using Python requests for data collection and parsing, PostgreSQL for database management, RStudio for analysis and visualization, and RShiny/RMarkdown for deoployment and report generation. 

My previous work includes Natural Language Processing for hatespeech detection in Tweets, [Indeed Job Posting Analysis](https://github.com/colingreen18/job_posting_analysis/blob/main/indeed_scraping/Indeed%20Scraping.pdf), a [Mortality Rate prediction for Covid19 patients](https://sean-z.shinyapps.io/covid_analysis/), a [stock market analytics tool](https://colin-green.shinyapps.io/stock-evaluator/) using fundamental analysis and a [house price prediction tool for the GTA](https://colin-green.shinyapps.io/gta_house_prices/).
